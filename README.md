# Programming Language Project - Lab 1

1) What are the boolean values in your language? 
<br>

2) What types of conditional statements are available in your language? 
<br><br>

3) Does your language use short-circuit evaluation? Include an example.
<br><br> 

4) How does your programming language deal with the “dangling else” problem? 
<br><br>

5) If your language supports switch or case statements, do you have to use
“break” to get out of them? Can you use “continue” to have all of them
evaluated?
